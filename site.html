                <img id="aboutmepic" src="aboutmepic.png">
                <p>In short I'm a hard working and diligent young man. 
                    My father always told me "If there's 
                    anything that you learn from me it's do your 
                    job and do it well; that will take you far." 
                    So that's what I did. You can ask any of my 
                    previous employers they will all tell you 
                    that I am a dependable, reliable, and stable 
                    employee who does his job and does it well. 
                    Not only that my customer service skills are 
                    something that I take pride in, combine that 
                    with my love of technology and you got yourself 
                    one of the hardest workers available in the tech field. 
                    Give me a chance and you won't regret it.</p> 
                <p>When I'm not working or studying, I absolutly love to travel.
                    So far the place that I have been to and love the most is New Zealand.
                    If you havent been then you definatly need to go. 
                    Check out one of the photos that I took to see what you are missing.
